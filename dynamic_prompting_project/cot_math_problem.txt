[EXAMPLE]

Question: A farmer has 15 apples. He sells 3 to his neighbor. He then picks 5 more apples from his orchard. How many apples does the farmer have now?

Thought:
1.  The farmer starts with 15 apples.
2.  He sells 3 apples, so I need to subtract 3 from 15. 15 - 3 = 12 apples.
3.  He then picks 5 more apples, so I need to add 5 to the current amount. 12 + 5 = 17 apples.
4.  The final number of apples is 17.

Answer: 17
